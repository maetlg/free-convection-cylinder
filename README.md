# free-convection-cylinder

OpenFOAM parameter files to solve the natural convection flow for a heated horizontal cylinder under an adiabatic wall. For a range of Rayleigh numbers and ceiling-to-cylinder distances, a cellular instability is triggered, as discussed in the work *Cellular vortex formation between a heated horizontal cylinder and an adiabatic upper wall* (under review).

Tested in OpenFOAM-7.
